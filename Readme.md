# Cellular Forms Growth Simulation

This is my implementation of the paper "Cellular Forms: an Artistic Exploration of Morphogenesis".
The python code is used to simulate the growth of cells, and the cpp Ray Tracer is used for 3D visualization.

I included some example output videos that you can enjoy!
